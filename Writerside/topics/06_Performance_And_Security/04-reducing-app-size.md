# Reducing App Size

To make your app as small as possible,
you should enable `shrinking` in your release build to remove unused code and resources.

`shrinking` does :
- **Obfuscation**, which shortens the names of your app’s classes and members
- **Optimization**, which applies more aggressive strategies to further reduce the size of your app.
